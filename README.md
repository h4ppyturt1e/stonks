## Introduction
Welcome to our **GPT-4 based sentiment analysis project**. This tool is designed to assist users in making informed decisions about buying or selling stocks. It aims to analyze sentiment from various news outlets and financial data sources to provide insights into the potential performance of popular company stocks. 

Eventually, the project's goal is to include a simulated "portfolio" feature, allowing users to experiment with stock trading in a risk-free environment.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 to analyze news data and evaluate the sentiment towards various stocks.
- **Stock Data Integration:** Fetches real-time data from popular stock market APIs.
- **Intuitive Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface to view stock sentiments, portfolio performance, and other relevant data.

Future goals:
- **Simulated Portfolio:** Users can manage a fake portfolio to test trading strategies based on the sentiment analysis.
